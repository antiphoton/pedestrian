	\section{Introduction}
		The social force model was first introduced in 1995 \cite{helbing1995social}. The motion of pedestrians was described as h
		The social force model of pedestrain has been investigated \cite{helbing1995social,helbing1998generalized},
		and some self-organized pedestrain traffic has been simulated \cite{helbing2005self}.

		However, in some cases, this model still needs to be revised. In this work, some new potentials are introduced, calibrated and validated.
